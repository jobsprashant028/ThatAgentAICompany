# Professional Portfolio (Static Site)

This is a lightweight, recruiter‑ready portfolio for **ThatAgentAICompany** — drop it into the root of your GitHub Pages repo.

## Files
- `index.html` — single-page site (hero, about, projects, skills, contact)
- `assets/styles.css` — clean, modern styles
- `assets/script.js` — tiny enhancement (year in footer)
- `assets/resume.pdf` — put your actual resume here (replace the placeholder)

## Customize
- Replace links in `index.html` (GitHub, LinkedIn, email)
- Swap project card text/links
- Upload your real `assets/resume.pdf`

## Deploy
Commit these files to your `main` branch. If an `index.md` exists, `index.html` will take precedence on GitHub Pages.

## Notes
- No build step, no frameworks — pure static. Fast and reliable.
